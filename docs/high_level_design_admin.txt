Administrative Process High-level Design
========================================

The administrative process runs as a bash shell script from the root login (just like the web server, itself):

    bin/diyca_admin.sh

The menu appears as follows:

	* Admin Menu *
	* ========== *
	* 
	* 1 - Shut down web server
	* 2 - Set user password to 123456
	* 3 - Delete user
	* x/X - Exit
	* 
	* Selection:

Function 1 is used to shutdown the web server in an emergency basis or for convenience during development.  It relies on a PID file stored by the web server containing a process ID with which to use as an argument to issue a SIGTERM.

Function 2 is used when a user forgets their password and needs a reset to a known value.

Function 3 is used to permanently remove a user.
