Put Calvin's certificate in the "certs" subdirectory, parallel to "alice"
and "bob".
[Calvin is the Certificate Authority at the  diyca web server 
running on the Raspberry Pi]

E.g. cd certs; rsync pi@192.168.1.103:/opt/diyca/certs/diyca_calvin.crt .

Using a browser, connect to the diyca web server and obtain 
CRT files for alice and bob by using the "csr" function from the main menu.

Copy or move the CRT files from your browser Downloads directory
to the certs subdirectory.
